# Predicting NBA Basketball Game Outcomes

Predicting the results of NBA basketball games is important for both fans and team management staff. The purpose of this study is to predict the outcomes of NBA basketball games using a multivariate quadratic polynomial method and compare it with standard linear regression. 

Two types of datasets were used in creating this prediction model to analyze how a team's total points are influenced by player scoring, successful 3-point shooting by players, successful free throws by players, and the last pass by a player before scoring. These datasets are named Dataset 18 and Dataset 22. Dataset 18 was used to build the first model, called Model 18, and Dataset 22 was used to build the second model, called Model 22. 

The results of the study indicate that the multivariate quadratic polynomial method used in Model 22 provided more accurate predictions, with an accuracy of 0.84278. These findings can be used as a tool for fans and team management staff to predict the outcomes of NBA basketball games.
